      summary: Create a charge
      description: |
        This endpoint will be called by cliqqpay whenever a Time based One Time Pin(TOTP) 
        from an E-money issuer partner is presented as payment for goods and/or services
        as well as for reversal processing
      
      
        Issuer partners implementing this API must respond within 8 seconds or be timed out.
        When a transaction is timed out, cliqqpay will resend the transaction 
        with the retry flag set to true and will wait for another 8 seconds.
        
        When no response is received, the terminal will time out and will queue a reversal message.
        
        For reversals, cliqqpay will send a request with reversal:true in the body
